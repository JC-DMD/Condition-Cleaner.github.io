## General

### [Parcel Viewer (City Staff)](https://gis.kcmogis.kc.lan/apps/parcelviewer/?eg=t)
>This is the main internal Parcel Viewer. It is only accessible via our network, and displays information not immediately available to the public. When clicking a link to a parcel-associated case in EnerGov, this version opens on the EnerGov (internal) side. If you remove the "?eg=t" from the end of the URL [(or click here)](https://gis.kcmogis.kc.lan/apps/parcelviewer/) when a link is clicked to an EnerGov case it will instead take you to [CompassKC](https://compasskc.kcmo.org/EnerGov_Prod/SelfService) (which is customer-facing EnerGov).
